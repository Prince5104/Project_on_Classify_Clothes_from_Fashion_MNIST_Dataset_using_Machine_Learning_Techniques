# Project_on_Classify_Clothes_from_Fashion_MNIST_Dataset_using_Machine_Learning_Techniques
Classify Clothes from Fashion MNIST Dataset with a couple of Machine Learning algorithms like SGD Classifier, XGBClassifier, Softmax Regression (multi-class LogisticRegression), DecisionTreeClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, Ensemble (with soft voting) using scikit-learn. In this project, you will use Python and scikit-learn to build ML model.
